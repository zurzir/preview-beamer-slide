We consider a relaxed version of the triangle inequality: a connection cost
function $c$ is called a \emph{squared metric}, if
$\sqrt{c_{ij}}\leq\sqrt{c_{ij'}} + \sqrt{c_{i'j'}} + \sqrt{c_{i'j}}$ for all
$i$, $i' \in F$, and $j$, $j' \in C$. The particular case of the \flp that only
considers instances with a squared metric is called the \squmetfacloc (\smflp).
Notice that the \smflp is a generalization of the \seflp and of the \mflp.
% Thus any
% approximation for the \smflp is also an approximation for the \seflp or the
% \mflp, and the inapproximability results for the \mflp are also valid for the
% \smflp.
